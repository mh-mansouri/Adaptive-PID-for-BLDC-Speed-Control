# Adaptive-PID-for-BLDC-Speed-Control
The major of this project is to show how to design and implement an adaptive PID (APID) for your power system. The adaptive PID designed, compares the reference speed with the actual speed of BLDC. The output of PID then feeds a controlled voltage source attached to a universal 3-phase bridge, the bridge that is connected to a BLDC motor.
